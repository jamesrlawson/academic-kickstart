In this project, led by [Dr. Rachael Gallagher](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/rachael-gallagher) and [Dr. Vanessa Adams](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/vanessa-adams), our team reviewed [NSW Office of Environment & Heritage's Saving our Species [Keep Watch Management Stream](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/threatened-species/saving-our-species-program/threatened-species-conservation/keep-watch-species). Species assigned to this management stream must be highly likely to be secure in the wild in NSW over the next 100 years in the absence of any targeted conservation management. We revised the critiera for species to be eligible for this management stream, and conducted a quantitative review of the status of the 104 species assigned to Keep Watch. My role in this project was the primary data scientist and analyst, in addition to codeveloping the revised Keep Watch Criteria.
